    # over-consumption-ratio sets the percentage about how much resource more than the requested can be used
    # to accomplish the rolling upgrade.
    #
    # By default, the number is 25, meaning 25% more of the resources we can allocate to roll out a new revision,
    # based on an existing revision. For example, the existing revision has 8 pods running, and we create a new
    # revision to replace it. During the transitional phase from the existing revision to this new revision, we
    # allow the total maximum number of pods to reach 8+8*25%=10 pods. Each stage, we roll out 25% more, adding
    # two more pods to the new revision and reducing two pods of the existing revision.
    over-consumption-ratio: "25"
